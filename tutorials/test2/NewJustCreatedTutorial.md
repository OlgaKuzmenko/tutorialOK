It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with ***Markdown***.

* ffffffffffffff ![Example](/img/cq5dam.thumbnail.319.319.png)
* fffffffffffffffffd

> citation
>> citation1

> If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!
